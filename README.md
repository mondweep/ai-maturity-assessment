# AI Maturity Assessment Application

## Overview

The AI Maturity Assessment application is a web-based tool designed to help organizations evaluate their AI readiness and implementation maturity. The application guides users through a series of questions about their organization, current AI initiatives, goals, and resources, ultimately providing a maturity score and tailored recommendations.

## Project Structure

This project contains the complete specification and pseudocode for the AI Maturity Assessment application. The documentation is organized as follows:

```

```

## Key Features

- **Multi-step Assessment Flow**: Guide users through a logical progression of questions
- **Branching Paths**: Adapt questions based on previous responses
- **Goal-specific Questions**: Ask relevant qualifying questions based on selected goals
- **Maturity Scoring**: Calculate an AI maturity score based on responses
- **Tailored Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations based on assessment results
- **Clean, Simple UX**: Present a user-friendly interface with appropriate CSS styling
- **Responsive Design**: Support all device sizes from mobile to desktop
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is accessible to all users

## Assessment Flow

1. **Demographics**: Collect basic organization information (industry, size)
2. **Journey Status**: Determine current AI implementation status
3. **Journey Questions**: Ask specific questions based on journey status
4. **Goals Selection**: Allow selection of AI implementation goals
5. **Qualifying Questions**: Ask specific questions based on selected goals
6. **Budget and Timeline**: Gather resource allocation information
7. **Results**: Display maturity score and recommendations

## Maturity Score Calculation

The maturity score is calculated based on three main components:

1. **Implementation Score (40%)**: Based on current AI journey status
2. **Strategy Score (30%)**: Based on selected goals and alignment
3. **Readiness Score (30%)**: Based on budget and timeline commitments

## Implementation Guide

For developers implementing this application, please refer to the [Implementation Summary](docs/08_implementation_summary.md) document for detailed guidance on:

- Recommended technology stack
- Implementation steps
- Key considerations
- Testing strategy
- Deployment considerations

## Document Navigation

- Start with the [Requirements](docs/01_requirements.md) to understand the application's functional and non-functional requirements
- Review the [Domain Model](docs/02_domain_model.md) to understand the core entities and data structures
- Explore the [Application Structure](docs/03_pseudocode_structure.md) to understand the overall organization
- Dive into the [Pages](docs/04_pseudocode_pages.md) and [Components](docs/05_pseudocode_components.md) pseudocode for implementation details
- Understand the [Context and State Management](docs/06_pseudocode_context.md) approach
- Review the [Styling](docs/07_pseudocode_styling.md) guidelines for UI implementation

## Development Approach

This specification follows a modular design approach with:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Component-based architecture
- Centralized state management
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility best practices
- TDD anchors for testability

Each pseudocode file includes TDD anchors (comments starting with `// TEST:`) that highlight key testing points for implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Review the complete specification
2. Set up the development environment
3. Implement the core application structure
4. Develop the individual pages and components
5. Implement the state management
6. Apply styling and ensure responsive design
7. Test thoroughly across devices and scenarios
8. Deploy the application
