## AI Maturity Assessment Application Architecture

### 1. Component Structure and Responsibilities

*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Responsible for rendering the assessment questions, collecting user inputs, and displaying the final score.
    *   Utilizes a responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.
    *   Framework: React/Vue.js

*   **Assessment Engine:**
    *   Orchestrates the assessment flow, including question sequencing and conditional logic.
    *   Manages the state of the assessment, including user answers and progress.
    *   Handles qualifying questions for green box options (e.g., asking about manual hours for "Automate Operations").

*   **Scoring Engine:**
    *   Calculates the AI maturity score based on user answers and a predefined scoring algorithm.
    *   Implements a weighted average approach, where different questions contribute differently to the final score.

*   **Data Store:**
    *   Persists user answers and assessment progress.
    *   Utilizes local storage or a state management library like Redux for data persistence.

### 2. Data Flow

1.  The user interacts with the UI to answer assessment questions.
2.  The UI sends the user's answers to the Assessment Engine.
3.  The Assessment Engine stores the answers in the Data Store.
4.  The Assessment Engine retrieves the answers from the Data Store.
5.  The Assessment Engine calculates the AI maturity score using the Scoring Engine.
6.  The Scoring Engine returns the score to the Results component.
7.  The Results component displays the score in the UI.

### 3. State Management Approach

*   Utilize a state management library like Redux or Context API to manage the assessment state.
*   Store user answers, assessment progress, and the final score in the state.
*   Implement actions and reducers to update the state based on user interactions.

### 4. Scoring Algorithm Design

*   Implement a weighted average approach to calculate the AI maturity score.
*   Assign different weights to different questions based on their importance.
*   Define a scoring rubric that maps user answers to numerical scores.
*   Calculate the final score by summing the weighted scores for all questions.

### 5. Responsive UI Architecture

*   Utilize a responsive CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI to create a responsive UI.
*   Design the UI to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
*   Use media queries to adjust the layout and styling of the UI based on the screen size.

### 6. Key Interfaces Between Modules

*   **UI <-> Assessment Engine:**
    *   The UI sends user answers to the Assessment Engine via function calls or events.
    *   The Assessment Engine updates the UI with the assessment progress and the final score.

*   **Assessment Engine <-> Scoring Engine:**
    *   The Assessment Engine sends user answers to the Scoring Engine via function calls.
    *   The Scoring Engine returns the AI maturity score to the Assessment Engine.

*   **Assessment Engine <-> Data Store:**
    *   The Assessment Engine stores user answers in the Data Store via function calls.
    *   The Data Store retrieves user answers for the Assessment Engine.
